## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?Timely delivery ensures customer satisfaction, prevents cost overruns, and maintains a competitive edge.
To ensure deadlines are met, project managers can:
Set clear milestones and realistic deadlines.
Use Agile methodologies for flexibility.
Monitor progress with tools like Gantt charts.
Identify risks early and allocate buffer time.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?Prevents financial losses, ensures sustainability, and increases ROI.
Strategies to prevent budget overruns:
Use cost estimation techniques (e.g., bottom-up budgeting).
Monitor expenses with real-time dashboards.
Manage scope creep by setting clear requirements.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?Agile: Iterative, flexible, customer feedback-driven.
Faster adaptability, continuous delivery.
 Harder to predict costs/time, needs strong team collaboration.
Waterfall: Sequential, structured, clear documentation.
 Clear scope, easier cost estimation.
 Less flexibility, risk of late-stage failure.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?Best for dynamic projects needing frequent changes.
Example: Mobile app with evolving features.
Waterfall: Best for fixed-scope projects with regulatory requirements.
Example: Banking software with strict compliance rules
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?Implement automated & manual testing.
Follow coding standards (CI/CD pipelines).
Conduct regular code reviews & security audit
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?Prevents scope creep and aligns expectations.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Breaks a project into manageable tasks, making tracking easier.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?Helps track progress, allocate resources efficiently.
Gantt charts visually map timelines, dependencies, and workloads.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience? my projects are as follows and here are some of the solutionson board,Jabali App: Supports autistic children with personalized learning.
GBV App: Provides prevention & support mechanisms.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?Ensures the solution meets actual user needs and avoids unnecessary features.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?Example for Jabali: "An interactive learning app designed to help children with autism develop essential skills at their own pace.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?AI-driven learning adaptation (Jabali).
Chatbots & emergency response (GBV app).
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?The global autism learning solutions market and digital safety apps market are growing, indicating potential demand.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?Understanding competitor gaps and emerging tech (e.g., AI in education, cybersecurity for GBV apps) helps refine features.
